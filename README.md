For this project I was required to use only window.alert() and window.prompt() for the user interface, which forced me to have to think more creatively. I was given a JSON style database of people, and had to build all the functions to search for them and sort them out by the specified criteria, using recursion and higher order functions.

Finds and displays not only personal attributes of selected individuals, but also their spouse, children, parents, siblings, ancestors, descendants, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, and next of kin.
